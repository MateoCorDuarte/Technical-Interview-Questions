/*
A waiting area in a barbershop has very limited space. There are three barbers, 
and two categories of customer: child and adult. 
Barbers 1 and 2 cut only the hair of adults, while barber 3 cuts only children’s hair. 
There are 8 waiting spaces. Customers must come alone, except that children must come with one parent; 
no one is allowed entry if there is no waiting space. One haircut takes 12 minutes, with 1 minute gap before the next customer. 
Once their hair is cut, customers leave the shop without re-entering the waiting area; 
children’s parents however remain in the waiting area until their child’s haircut is complete. The wall on the clock ticks every minute. 
In the case of a fire alarm, all customers must leave the shop in an orderly fashion.
